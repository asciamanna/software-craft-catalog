# Software Craft Catalog

A single place to collect blog posts, talks, and other materials about Test-Driven Development (TDD), unit testing / microtesting, eXtreme Programming (XP), Lean Software Development, Modern Agile, etc.

## Purpose

Over the years I have accumulated a wealth of blog posts and talks about software development in Evernote. I'm attempting to make my collection of this material available to a wider audience. I often reference this material in my blog posts or at work.
