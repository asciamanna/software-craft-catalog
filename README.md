# Software Craft Catalog
A single place to collect blog posts, talks, and other materials about code craft, Test-Driven Development (TDD), unit testing / microtesting, eXtreme Programming (XP), etc.

## Purpose
Over the years I have accumulated a wealth of blog posts and talks about software development in Evernote. I'm attempting to make my collection of this material available to a wider audience. I often reference this material in my blog posts or at work.
